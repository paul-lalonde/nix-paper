  abstract =     "Plan 9 is a distributed computing environment. It is
                 assembled from separate machines acting as CPU servers,
                 file servers, and terminals. The pieces are connected
                 by a single file-oriented protocol and local name space
                 operations. By building the system from distinct,
                 specialised components rather than from similar
                 general-purpose components, Plan 9 achieves levels of
                 efficiency, security, simplicity, and reliability
                 seldom realised in other distributed systems. This
                 paper discusses the building blocks, interconnections,
                 and conventions of Plan 9.",
